            Les patch notes désignent une liste de changements qui sont ajoutés au jeu via les mises à jour.
            Ces patch notes sont présentés sous la forme d'un tableau mettant, pour le cas d'un changement
            pour un personnage, le nom du personnage, le coup qui a subi un changement, et enfin la modification
            qu'il a reçu.
